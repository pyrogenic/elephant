# Elephant

A collection management tool for Discogs. It runs 100% in-browser â€” you don't need to give anyone else access to your account. [Try it out](https://pyrogenic.github.io/elephant/)!

Elephant uses [my fork](https://github.com/pyrogenic/discojs) of [DiscoJS](https://github.com/aknorw/discojs) to talk to Discogs. It stores information about your collection in your browser's database. It can create marketplace listings from items in your collection with just a few clicks, too.
